# Statistical-Inference <sup> $\gamma$.
This personal project aims to delve into fundamental statistical inference techniques, enabling users to draw meaningful conclusions from datasets. At its current stage, as of May 26th of 2024, the repository houses code dedicated to single population hypothesis testing. However, this is just the beginning.

# Purpose
A p-value is just a number if you don't know what to do with it. For instance, what does a person not versed in statistics do when they see "p-value = 0.04" on a matrix of statistical numbers? There are several software programs, like MiniTab, R, and SAS, that help in inferential statistics by providing numerical values that we use to draw conclusions. This project does somewhat the same, but instead of just the numbers, you will be given an understanding of what those numbers mean. In other words, the interpretation will be done for you.

There may be other software out there that may make this project redundant. However, this is my personal project that I plan to further develop by automating and evolving it with the use of machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and other artificial intelligence concepts. At the moment, I am restricted by my knowledge, but this will soon no longer be a limitation once I expand my intellectual horizons. For now, this is my take on a program that makes statistical inferences for you.

Please note that this project is a work in progress and is being worked on as you read this. You may not be seeing the most recent python file when navigating through this repository. I will make updates as I progress.

# About Code
The class <span style="color:blue"> Hyp_Test_1Pop </span>, conducts hypothesis tests single-populations. Object uses the inputs: **var_X, var_Y, unit, data_Y, P_hyp, alp, para, testType,** and **P_StdDev**.
